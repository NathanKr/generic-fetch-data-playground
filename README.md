<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>useFetchData is a custom hook that can fetch data and validate it. It return [data, isLoading, error]</p>
<p>given isLoading we might want to show progress .Given error we might want to show error .So why not do a component for this ? - thats the purpose of this repository</p>
